## 2. Design and Simulation of Microfluidic Chip

### 2.1 Principle of Microfluidic Chip

Due to the wide range of particle sizes and diverse densities of microplastics, existing physical and chemical methods have shortcomings in separation efficiency and accuracy. Thus, microfluidic-based squeeze flow separation (PFF) and asymmetric squeeze flow separation (AsPFF) bring an efficient and controllable solution for microplastic screening [6]. Efficient sample separation and detection are realized by microchannels. The microplastic-containing fluid sample converges with pure fluid in the microchannel, and the microplastics are classified by particle size and density through the flow velocity gradient and the lift force induced by the channel wall.

In this paper, a microfluidic chip based on extrusion flow separation and asymmetric extrusion flow separation is designed. The chip mainly consists of three modules: particle size screening channel, density sorting and enrichment channel as well as Raman spectroscopy detection module. The top of the chip adopts a transparent design for easy observation and detection. The sample enters the chip through an inlet and first enters a particle-size sieving channel, which contains multiple outlets. One of outlets is dedicated to sieving out the microplastic sample. The sieved sample then enters a density sorting and enrichment channel connected thereto, where the sample is further enriched. The enriched sample is optically detected by the Raman spectroscopy detection module, and the final sample flows out of the outlet.

### 2.2 Particle Size Screening Channel

#### 2.2.1 Basic Principles and Design

This study designed a multi-layer screen structure to achieve efficient hierarchical screening of microplastic particles, which was separated according to the particle size by screens with different aperture sizes. The pore size of each layer of the screen gradually decreases from top to bottom, ensuring that particles of different sizes are effectively filtered in different screen levels. The simulation model considers the interaction between particle flow and screen structure, optimizes the screen structure and flow rate setting, and improves the classification screening efficiency. The left inlet of this part takes over the branch outlet of the previous step, as shown in the screen structure shown in Figure 1 (a). With the flow of particles, the screens with mesh holes of different sizes passively filter out particles of different sizes and particle sizes and gather them in this area. In order to ensure that the n-s equation has a solution, the pressure level is specified by the pressure point constraint.
